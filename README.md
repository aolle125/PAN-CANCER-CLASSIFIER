路	We use the cancer transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas PanCancerAtlas project to interrogate gene expression states induced by deleterious mutations 
路	mutations and copy number alterations and predict the type of cancer for a given expression
路	Performed Dimensionality Reduction on the data by converting set of possibly correlated genetical features into linearly uncorrelated variables using PCA and t-SNE
路	Used Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machines for prediction with a 99.17% cross-validation accuracy after hyper-parameter tuning
