We use the cancer transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas PanCancerAtlas project to interrogate gene expression states induced by deleterious mutations and copy number alterations and predict the type of cancer for a given expression
Performed Dimensionality Reduction on the data by converting set of possibly correlated genetical features into linearly uncorrelated variables using PCA and t-SNE
Used Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machines for prediction with a 99.17% cross-validation accuracy after hyper-parameter tuning
